## MSC RESEARCH PROPOSAL Lesson Notes

This module is for MSC RESEARCH PROPOSAL lesson notes.

## Overview

# WEEK 1

# Intro

* The different types of computing projects identified by Dawson (2015) are as follows:
    * Research-based
    * Development
    * Evaluation
    * Industry-based
    * Problem solving

## The research process

* identify four common views of the research process: sequential, generalised, circulatory and evolutionary:
* Sequential:
    * Steps:
        1. Identify the broad area of study.
        2. Select a research topic.
        3. Decide on an approach.
        4. Plan how you will perform the research.
        5. Gather data and information.
        6. Analyse and interpret these data.
        7. Present the results and findings.
    * Greenfield breaks the research process into four steps:
        * Review the field – i.e., perform a literature survey.
        * Build a theory – based on your understanding and interpretations of the field.
        * Test the theory – does it work?
        * Reflect and integrate – i.e., update your ideas based on your ‘tests’ and contribute your newfound knowledge
          to others.
* Generalised: The generalised research process is identical to the sequential process in that a defined sequence of
  activities is performed one after the other.
* Circulatory. The circulatory approach recognises that any research is really only part of a continuous cycle of
  discovery and investigation. Quite often, research will un- cover more questions than it answers and, hence, the
  research process can begin again by attempting to answer these newfound questions.
* Evolutionary. The evolutionary concept takes the circulatory interpretation one step further and recognises that
  research must evolve and change over time, not necessar- ily following a defined circulatory pattern or repeating the
  same forms of analysis and interpretation that were performed before.

* Orna and Stevens (loc. cit.) identify the search definition as an attempt to answer the following questions:
    * ‘What am I looking for?’
    * ‘Why am I looking for it?’
    * ‘How shall I set about it?’
    * ‘Where shall I start looking?’

## Intellectual discovery

* When you are looking for questions to answer and answers to those questions, you will often follow a complex process
  of inductive and deductive reasoning.
* Inductive reasoning.
    * You start with your observations of the world and come to general conclusions about it. In other words, you build
      models and theories based on your interpretation of the world. Clearly, this interpretation will depend on the
      data and information you can draw from the world, the subject/problem you are studying and, importantly, what you
      already know and believe.
    * The knowledge that you can obtain from what you are studying is referred to as epistemology (Cornford and
      Smithson, 2006: 61). You can either draw general con- clusions from what you observe and from what you are
      studying and apply them to other things (positivism), or you can only induce knowledge unique to yourself and the
      particular situation under study (anti-positivism).
* Deductive reasoning.
    * You start with your knowledge and understanding of the world and predict likely observations within it, even
      though you might not have encountered them before.
      Deductive reasoning is affected by your theory of reality, your own personal understanding of the world and your
      underlying assumptions about what you are investigating. This is referred to as ontology. Different people might
      deduce different things as their understanding differs from your own and they see things in different ways.
* If you are having difficulty solving a problem, two interesting methods of intellectual discovery listed by
  Greenfield (1996: 5) that might help are:
    * ‘The method of Pappus: assume the problem is solved and calculate backwards’
    * ‘The method of Terullus: assume a solution is impossible and try to prove why’

## Fields of study

* Research can be classified from three different perspectives; its field, its approach and its nature.
* "field" is a method to label groups of researchers with similar research interests. It is also referred to as an area
  of interest.
    * Applied computer science
    * Artificial intelligence
    * Computer architectures and hardware
    * Databases
    * Formal methods
    * Graphics and visualisation
    * Human computer interaction
    * Image processing, vision, pattern recognition
    * Information systems
    * Networking
    * Security and cryptography
    * Software engineering
    * Theoretical computer science
* "approach" is the term approach is used to refer to research methods that are used as part of the research process.
* Categories of the "nature":
    * Category 1: Pure theoretical development
    * Category 2: Research that reviews pure theory to ascertain its potential for practical application.
    * Category 3: Applied research that has in part practical application or outcome. Sharp et al (2002)

## Research topics and units of analysis

* `Research object’ - this is the topic or phenomenon from which you wish to generate knowledge. For the purposes of
  this module we will use the terms ‘topic’ or ‘phenomenon’ because in computer science, ‘research object’ is a term
  that is used to describe an aggregation of research on the web.
* The ‘Topic’ is used to describe/label the subject or subject matter you are concerned with. [2] Initially you will
  start with a broad topic which you will need to define more narrowly in order to ensure your project has a viable
  scope.
* While choosing topic you need to concider :
    * What phenomena are of interest in the field?
    * What are the main problems or topics of interest?
    * What are the boundaries of the field?
* How to develop a topic for your Research.
    * Specialist Themes: if you are in MsComputer Science with Data Analytics you need to choose a topic related with
      Data
    * Types Of Project:
        * Research-based
        * Development
        * Evaluation
        * Industry-based
        * Problem-solving
    * What makes a topic really good?
        * It is a topic that interests you
        * Make sure it is creative, not written about repeatedly
        * It is not too broad
    * <img src="./img/1.png" alt="alt text" width="500" height="300">
    * <img src="./img/2.png" alt="alt text" width="500" height="300">
* What is a good Research?
    * Open minds. You should work with an ‘open system of thought’. Be open minded to the questions posed. ‘Conventional
      wisdom and accepted doctrine . . . may turn out to be inadequate’.
    * Critical analysis. Examine data critically. Are these figures correct? Have they been affected in some way? What
      do these data really mean? Are alternative data available? Can these data be interpreted differently?
    * Generalisations. Researchers generalise and specify limits on the generalisations they identify. Generalisation
      allows research to be interpreted and applied to a wide variety of situations. However, researchers must know the
      limitations of these generalisa- tions. Generalisations stem from your own wisdom and evolve from your deductive
      reasoning which leads you to develop ideas about things you have not encountered before with certain caveats.

* Review of the Literature:
    * This literature review helps to determine whether the topic is worth studying, and it provides insight into ways
      in which the researcher can limit the scope to a needed area of inquiry.

## Clustering

* Dawson refers to three methods of clustering, as follows:
    * Research Territory Maps (RTM)/Affinity maps
    * Relevance tree
    * Spider diagram
* Clustering is a method of further defining your topic into related topics and links between them in the case of RTM’s.
* Or you can use a relevance tree to take a high-level thought process about a field and make it more specific.
* Although spider diagrams are similar to both of these in that they can provide a high-level diagram like an RTM they
  can also offer the opportunity to break down the topic like a relevance tree.

# WEEK 2

# Literature review: establishing relevance

# Research Process

* A literature survey will help you to justify your project, set your project context and provide an undertaking of how
  your project evolved. The latter helps if other researchers want to carry on with your research as they're able to see
  where you left off. Some may consider this stage as the foundation of your project. [1][2]
* The literature survey helps to develop the relevance of your possible topic. Your findings will help to establish the
  following key information about your topic:
    * Has it been researched before?
    * Is the topic important and, if so, to which fields of research?
    * What methodologies/methods have been used to study it before?

## Things to consider could include the following

1. The size of the research project (The final project has a time limitation)

2. Availability of the data

3. Depending on the project are there any ethics issues that would need addressing

4. What artifact will you produce in relation to the topic

5. Personally I would look at the topic that holds the most interest for you as you will be stuck with it throughout the
   final project.

### 2.3.1 Literature survey process

* **Price validation**:
* Topic: Developing a Time-Series Model Pipeline for Accurate Price Validation of Products
* Redefined Topic: Developing Pipeline to build Price Validator Service for Products by using deep learning LSTM Time
  Series Model.
* Known knows: Seasons can effect the demand of the products and change the prices. Merchants can make mistake to set
  prices and revert but this mistakes effect the consumers and leads the customers in wrong directions. ML can help to
  forecast the data by looking at historical data and prevent. A cloud base pipeline can hlp to build realtime price
  forecasting.

## Literature Research

* A literature search is a ‘systematic gathering of published information relating to a subject’ (University of Derby,
  1995). There are two important terms italicised within this state- ment that require further explanation.
* Systematic:  The first is systematic. A literature search should not be performed in an ad hoc manner, but should be
  approached in a structured and professional way.
    * However, remember that you will never actually stop literature searching as you might still be
      gathering/understanding material in parallel with the rest of your work to the conclusion of your project.
* Published: This implies that the material which you trace should be recognised.
    * sing only material from sources on the Internet (such as Wikipedia) will undermine the legitimacy of your project.
* **Golder Rules while performing a literature search:**
    * Allow plenty of time – it can, and probably will, take a long time. Therefore, you should start as soon as
      possible, avoid procrastinating (see Chapter 7) and steer clear of material unrelated to your chosen topic.
    * Ensure that you make note of the full reference of any material you obtain. This will save a significant amount
      of time at the end of your project because you won’t waste time trying to remember precise details of articles you
      have read but have since lost or returned to your local library. It is also important to avoid plagiarising the
      work of others (plagiarism). The full reference will also be needed if you wish to apply
      for inter-library loans.]
* While making research on internet:
    * Some points that you should consider when evaluating the quality of material on the Internet include (some of
      these points are adapted from Ohio State University Library, 2008):
        * What is the purpose of the site – is it to provide information or to sell a product?
        * When was the site updated? How up-to-date is the material on the site? Is it still relevant?
        * Is the site part of (or related to) an official organisation (a professional body, government department or
          academic institute or research group)? For example, the IEEE, the Project Management Institute, British
          Computer Society, etc.?
        * Are there any copyright issues associated with the material? Will you be able to use the material without
          breaching copyright?
        * Is there an author for the material? Is the author qualified to provide the information? Are they presenting
          opinions rather than facts? Are they biased?
        * Is the site recognised from other sources? Is it a recognised body? Are there other links to the site and is
          it reviewed anywhere?
        * Is the material biased? ‘Does the author have a “vested interest” in the topic’ or an axe to grind?

### Some tips for performing a literature search

We finish this section with a few tips on undertaking a literature search:

* Note interesting quotes and their full reference as you go along. This will be invalu- able later when you write your
  report and try to trace your references.
* Use review articles and books to help your search.
* Reference correctly from the start (covered in Chapter 8).
* Know when to stop – or at least when to move on to the next stage of your project. You will know this from your
  project plan and the research boundaries, which you have set yourself.
* Have a system to organise and catalogue the material you read. The following section provides a discussion on how to
  manage your information effectively.
* Read recognised leaders and original theorists in your field.
* Start with a broad search before you focus; don’t jump straight into the most complicated recent article on your
  subject. You may be put off by its apparent complexity.)

* **Managing Information:**
    * The best way to begin managing your research is by using the conceptual model you have created of your subject
      area (using your RTM, relevance tree or spider diagram). Use this model to identify the topics in which you are
      interested and how these topics link together.

## Critical Reading

* The main point of critical evaluation is that you **think** about what you are reading.
* Critical reading involves examining the evidence or arguments presented, identifying what may
  have influenced the evidence or arguments, understanding the limitations of a study, the design,
  the scope of the research, consider the interpretations made, and from these, you consider to
  what extent you may agree or disagree with the author.
* Sources:
    * Academic resources:
        * Experts in field
        * Journalist -peer reviewed
    * Common sources
        * Reading lists
        * Yorsearch
        * Google
        * Academic sources
        * Data sources
* **Evaluation Criteria**
    * A circle containing 8 key words in boxes equally spaced around its circumference:
        * Authority: who is the author? Not only that, are they an expert in their field?
        * Audience, who's the article written for ?
        * Purpose, for what purpose? What is presented? Is the argument valid?
        * Quality of the content, the research being done, the design
        * Content, The information that is being presented
        * Currency, is it current? Is it relevant?
        * Accuracy, are the arguments accurate?
        * Suitability, is it appropriate? These can be answered by a few simple questions - who
          is the author? What else have they published? Have they been cited by anybody? Where was it
          published? Is the journal peer-reviewed?
* **Evaluating Sources Activity.**
    * Taking the articles you have found, now ask yourself the following questions:
        * What is different about them?
        * What is similar about them?
        * What would make them valuable to you for your Research Proposal and your IRP
          assessment?
        * Can you foresee any problems with them?
          o What are their limitations?
* **Critical Reading questions.**
    * What does the author claim?
    * What are the arguments, and how does the author record their claims?
    * Are there any opposing arguments presented?
    * Is there any bias in the source?
    * What research method is used?
    * How does the author qualify the argument in the text?
* Example of critical analyse:
    * The research method and supporting evidence lack rigour which means the
      author’s argument and conclusion are unconvincing
* [Critical Reading](https://subjectguides.york.ac.uk/critical/reading)
* Rudestam and Newton (2007: 67–68) suggest some additional points which should be considered when reading and
  critically evaluating articles.
* They break their points down into five key areas: **Conceptualization, Theoretical Framework and Hypotheses, Research
  Design, Results and Discussion, Summary**.
* Those which supplement the points made above and are applicable for computing projects can be summarised as:
    * What is the major problem or issue being investigated?
    * How clearly are the major concepts defined/explained?
    * Is there a clear research question/hypothesis that can be, and is, tested?
    * What type of research design/methodology is employed? Is it suitable and reliable?
    * Have algorithms and statistical techniques been used appropriately? Can you apply them in your own work? What are
      the limitations of these techniques?
    * Is the choice of measures, sample sizes and data appropriate? Have extraneous factors/variables been considered?
    * Can generalisations be made from these results? What are the limitations of these generalisations?
    * Are the implications of the results discussed?
    * What is your overall assessment of the study – in terms of its adequacy for explaining
      the research problem and the contribution it is making?
* This critical reading is defined by Blaxter et al. (2006: 117) using a number of points, some of which are listed
  below.
* They define a critical reading as one that:
    * ‘goes beyond mere description by offering opinions, and making a personal response, to what has been written’;
    * ‘relates different writings to each other’;
    * ‘does not take what is written at face value’;
    * ‘views research writing as a contested terrain, within which alternative views and positions may be taken up’.

### SQR3 Model for critical reading

* SQR3 stands for survey, question, read, recite, review
* Survey :
    * I highlight the titles first
    * Looking for charts and highlight, clear to jumps up
* Question:
    * Write questions what I want to have this paper to answer
    * I can see how this author dis/agree with my previous thought process
    * What do I need to know ? What do I want to get from this?
* Read:
    * Read selectively and section a time
    * I might have stick notes and write what does this section is telling me ? (Read and put definition )
    * Continue this for all sections.
    * Then look back to your questions and answer them what you find in any section
        * And if it answers your any question you can write sticky that this section answers
* Recite:
    * keypart :  in your own words
    * you gonna praphrasing some of those elements to support you in your discussion, use them in your reasearch
    * You need to think how can you summarise this article with your own words
        * What you say about it?
        * What the information?
        * What is the keypoints?
    * Then looking at your questions and answer them orally, without looking notes, then you can be sure you understand
      the paper.
* Review:
    * Check your notes, are they clear? Could you answer your questions on them? Did you fond your questions answers? Do
      you have more questions?
    * Review again and answer and notes does it make sence
    * Look at your questions later next days and try to recall

## Writing Literature review

* identify the purpose of a literature review as, amongst other things:
    * to refine your research question and objectives;
    * to highlight research possibilities that have either been explicitly identified by other authors or have possibly
      been overlooked in the past;
    * to avoid repeating the work of others;
    * to identify research methods and strategies that may be usefully applied in your own research.
* There are no specific, infallible rules you can apply to write the perfect literature review.
    * Saunders et al (2007: 61) identify three common ways for presenting literature reviews:
        * as a single chapter;
        * as a series of chapters;
        * subsumed within the report as various issues are tackled.
* When writing your literature review remember what it is **NOT**:
    * It is not a report that lists all the papers and books you have read whether they are relevant or not. You must be
      selective about that to which you refer.
    * It must not dedicate a page or paragraph to each article in turn merely reporting on their content. Haywood and
      Wragg (1982: 2) refer to this as ‘the furniture sales catalogue, in which everything merits a one-paragraph
      entry no matter how skilfully it has been conducted’ (see Figure 5.6).
* Example – An artificial neural network approach to rainfall-runoff modelling
    * Notice how this introduction/literature review begins by justifying the content of the paper with reference to a
      WMO report.
    * It continues by showing how the subject area has evolved over the years.
    * Literature reviews often employ this kind of approach – focusing in on the topic of concern through a
      chronological discussion of
      literature in the field.
    * This approach generally leads to a natural focus on the topic of concern.
    * The review then moves on to explain a little bit more about the area of study, setting the scene for the reader,
      before focussing
      more precisely and discussing some recent developments in research within the field.
    * The literature review concludes by highlighting current limitations in the field, once again justifying the
      relevance and importance of the paper by showing how it aims to fill these gaps.
* Literature review should cover the following four points:
    * Arrange relevant literature in the field.
    * Critically evaluate past and current research in the field.
    * Identify your project within a wider context.
    * Justify the existence of your project by identifying a gap in the field and showing how your project will fill
      that gap (particularly important at research degree level).
