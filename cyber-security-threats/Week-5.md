#### Main Topics

* At the end of this week, you should be able to:
    * Appreciate and explain the importance of databases in modern information systems
    * Identify and describe some common attacks against databases and how to prevent or mitigate them
    * Explain how data aggregation can increase threats to security
* This week we will be covering the following module learning outcomes:
    * (MO1) Identify and analyse major threat types in a variety of systems,
    * (MO4) Critically assess the relative merits of specific solution approaches for particular contexts,
    * (MO5) Critically discuss leading edge research in cyber security and the challenges faced.

# Intro

* A database is a collection of data and a set of rules that organize the data by specifying certain relationships among
  the data.
* A database administrator is a person who defines the rules that organize the data and also controls who should have
  access to what parts of the data.
* The user interacts with the database through a program called a database manager or a database management system (
  DBMS)
* A database is a collection of tables, each containing records having one or more fields or elements.
* The logical structure of a database is called a schema.
* The name of each column is called an attribute of the database.
    * A relation is a set of columns.
    * Relations in a database show some connection among data in tables.

* Users interact with database managers through commands to the DBMS that retrieve, modify, add, or delete fields and
  records of the database. A command is called a query.
* We can also merge two subschema on a common element by using a join query.
* Databases support controlled, shared access to a single repository of data.
* Advantages of DB:
    * • shared access, so that many users can use one common, centralized set of data • controlled access, so that only
      authorized users are allowed to view or to modify data values
    * • minimal redundancy, so that individual users do not have to collect and maintain their own sets of data
    * • data consistency, so that a change to a data value affects all users of the data value
    * • data integrity, so that data values are protected against accidental or malicious undesirable changes
