# Qualitative research methods

* Qualitative research uses words as opposed to the quantification in the collection of data.
* As a research strategy it is broadly inductivist, constructionist and interpretivist, but not necessarily all these
  things.
* Other features:
    * an inductive view of the relationship between theory and research, whereby the former is generated out of the
      latter (however, see the section below on abduction as a qualification of this view);
    * an epistemological position described as interpretivist, meaning that, in contrast to the adoption of a natural
      scientific model in quantitative research, the stress is on the understanding of the social world through an
      examination of the interpretation of that world by its participants; and
    * an ontological position described as constructionist, which implies that social properties are outcomes of the
      interactions between individuals, rather than phenomena ‘out there’ and separate from those involved in their
      construction.
* Desck-based (secondary data)
    * when selecting secondary source data, the researcher must take care to ensure it is:
        * Reliable: by asking questions such as who collected it, what were the sources of data, how and when was the
          data collected, was there any measurement bias within the methods used, what level of accuracy was achieved in
          collecting the data?
        * Suitable: by scrutinizing the original primary source of data – how was it defined, what units of collection
          were used and what was the scope, nature and purpose of the original research?
        * Adequate: by ensuring that the secondary data has a level of accuracy that is adequate for the purpose of the
          present enquiry; if it is inadequate, it should not be used.

# Typical strategies for collecting primary data in research

* Most commonly used strategies:
* **Case Study**:
    * What it can do
        * inquiry within a bounded real-life setting
        * exploratory, explanatory, descriptive research
        * deductive and inductive
        * single or multiple
    * Methods of data collection
        * interviews/focus groups
        * observation
        * questionnaires
        * document analysis (secondary data)
    * Benefits and limitations
        * case study allows for complexity, context and ‘messiness’ of a social setting
        * it allows for cross-organisational and inter-organisational comparisons
        * it is not useful for single theme research when a unitary approach can be used
        * it is not useful for research in a short time-frame
        * it can be difficult to know when to stop gathering data.

* Survey:
    * What it can do
        * deductive approach
        * explanatory and descriptive research
        * describes trends, attitudes and opinions of a given population
        * tests for associations between variables
    * Methods of data collection
        * questionnaire
        * structured observation
        * structured interviews
    * Benefits and limitations
        * effective for gathering a large amount of data from a large number of people
        * cost effective in terms of time and money
        * potential for generalisations to be made due to standardized approach
        * over-reliance on single instrument for data collection
        * explains ‘what’ and ‘how’ but not necessarily ‘why’
        * lack of depth and limited insight into the phenomenon being researched

* Action Research:
    * What it can do
        * applied ‘research in action’
        * pragmatic
        * feedback loop
        * participatory social process
    * Methods of data collection
        * observation
        * interviews/focus groups
        * questionnaires
        * document analysis
    * Benefits and limitations
        * focuses on practical solutions for real-world problems
        * participatory approach draws insights from stakeholders
        * allows for complexity and reflection on issues as they arise
        * difficult to manage feedback loop in a timely and responsive way
        * challenge of knowing when to stop collecting data
        * focus of the research can veer off course between reflection and action.

* Ethnography
    * What it can do
        * exploratory and descriptive research
        * in-depth observation in natural setting
        * researcher immersed within research site –firsthand interaction with ‘lived experience’
    * Methods of data collection
        * participant observation
        * interviews
        * field notes/diaries
        * digital and visual media
    * Benefits and limitations
        * gain in-depth knowledge of the phenomenon being researched
        * difficult to generalise from findings and risk of bias (researcher subjectivity)
        * resource-intensive
        * requires building rapport and trust between researcher and participants
        * ethical implications regarding access, participation and reflexivity.

* Grounded Theory
    * What it can do
        * inductive approach
        * exploratory
        * no preconceptions on what will be discovered
        * genuine, authentic reflection of issues important to participant
    * Methods of data collection
        * interviews
        * focus groups
        * observations
        * storytelling/narratives
    * Benefits and limitations
        * grounded theory produces data driven by the participants
        * it brings fresh perspectives to theory building
        * it offers rich in-depth insights to social phenomena that may be otherwise undiscovered
        * it produces qualitative, subjective data which may be problematic for stakeholders who seek evidence based on
          facts and figures
        * it is resource-intensive, protracted and difficult to do well.

* Stress tests
    * a. In an experiment, you would create different levels of stress in at least two groups and see how they differed.
      People would be placed in different groups randomly. You specify the groups associated with the IV and measure the
      DV.
    * b. In a case study, you study a single individual (or a few) in great depth. To study stress, you would keep
      detailed notes about the conditions in which the person experienced stress and how he or she coped, along with
      other reactions.
    * c. In archival research, you could identify some naturally occurring event and see how it affected people in terms
      of stress, such as increases in admissions to psychiatric facilities, death or suicide rates, divorces, or other
      records that could be associated with stress

* [Strengths and limitations of qualitative and quantitative research methods](https://en.calameo.com/read/004705816d2c2e2577576)

* Qualitative and quantitative research both operate upon the same spectrum but at different end of it. This means that
  they have many similarities (such as a need for validity and questions of repeatability) but many difference as well.
  The authors provide a good table of the differences upon page 3 but in essence it can be summarised thus:
* Quantitative research concentrates upon using numerical information to generalise whereas qualitative research uses
  non-numerical information to focus and understand the issue in great detail.
* In this neither approach, nor indeed any of their sub-approaches such as case studies or correlation studies, are
  better. In fact, in many situations a sufficient understanding can only be attained through combining both
  quantitative and qualitative research within the literature. Computer Science is often an exception to this.
* Within computer science we have a number of different areas, some of which are strictly mechanical. If we are looking
  at changing computer architecture to increase processing speeds for instance, qualitative research would be unlikely
  to generate new insights. However, for those areas that involve data that is not specific (such as opinions and
  feelings of users about an interface) using qualitative methods is necessary.
* An example of this is A/B testing which uses correlation study to provide quantitative data. As proven a method as
  this is, it provides no understanding of why an option was selected over another. This requires an approach like a
  survey and is one of the reasons websites still have the pop-ups asking you to give your opinion on how things went
  today.
* Within computer science it is also likely that most of the quantitative study’s are correlational in nature. To a
  large extent this will be due to the availability of data. With the advent of the IoT individual datapoints are being
  generated in staggering volume. These lend themselves to correlational study and most of the models within data
  science, such as decision trees, neural networks and regression, involve this.

* Quantitative and qualitative approaches towards research produce different outcomes and have different purposes and
  therefore, except for the broad brush terms, the paper highlights that there are different approaches for the
  different fields. In terms of surveys and correlational studies, the authors are right that they suit the quantitative
  approach more effectively, however the qualitative approach, for example in an interview senario could equally be
  termed as a survey or correlation study depending on how the interview is structured. The key phrase here is "mostly
  adopted" because the difference in approaches is not as black and white.
* In terms of computer science, the advantages and disadvantages of qualitative methods are arguably no different to
  other areas of research interest, especially where human variables are included.
