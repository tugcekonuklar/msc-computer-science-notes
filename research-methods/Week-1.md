# Academic writing

* Academic writing is different from general writing and great importance is placed on the structure of the work and the
  use of citations/referencing
* It must be write in formal language
    * contain no colloquialisms
    * slang or contractions (such as "don't", "can't" etc)
    * avoid personal pronouns (unless directed otherwise)
    * must adhere to a formal structure,
    * The tone must remain objective throughout
    * avoiding emotive language
    * cater to the audience
    * The rules of grammar must be followed
    * spell checked

* Faults:
    * poor referencing
        * you must introduce and discuss external resources to develop your point but DO NOT LET A QUOTE OR CITATION
          MAKE YOUR POINT FOR YOU!
        * it is important to include a paragraph after paragraph of quotes/citations to make their point
        * All quotes or references need to be in support of a point or assertion YOU are making and must not be
          standalone.

* Descriptive vs Academic Writing
    * Descriptive writing - represent facts and not contains who, what, where, how or why questions
    * Academic writing is evaluative and critical, investigating the significance of facts

* Making assertions in paragraphs
    * If you make a claim or assertion, you must back it up with evidence.
        * Statement is speculative without evidence and must be evidenced
    * Example : "Just because most programmers are good mathematicians does not mean that there are no non-mathematician
      programmers". This sentence is premised on the assumption about 'most programmers' which is not backed up with
      data or evidence. Also, the term 'mathematician' is problematic as it is value-laden and subjective.

* **Typically a paragraph might be constructed thus:**
    1. Introduce topic.
    2. Make a claim – back it up with a reference
    3. Make another supporting claim – back it up with a reference
    4. {Make a claim opposing your topic – back it up with evidence}. This strengthens your argument but not everyone
       does this
    5. Close your argument/paragraph.

* Each paragraph should end with a final statement that brings together the ideas brought up in the paragraph and which
  can also be used as the transition to the next sentence.
* Make sure your work is coherent – each point should be linked to the previous and subsequent points to improve the
  flow and logic of the piece.
* It might feel frustrating at first but you must remember when writing for academia that you must always always support
  your claims with research. Don't leave any claims as speculative – where and when your claim is endorsed in
  literature.

* Summarise
    * The claim is where you where you make your main point – it's a key part of academic argument. If there's no claim,
      there's no argument.
        * You need to support your claim with evidence.
    * We are talking about facts here, not opinions – good evidence backs up the points you make.
    * Justification is where you explain why the evidence supports the claim – sometimes this can be left out if it's
      obvious or a widely held belief.
    * Claim, evidence and justification all combine to produce a clear argument.
    * Counter-arguments are important. If you include them in your writing it shows that you have considered more than
      one side of an argument.
    * Tell your reader your limitations. This doesn't mean that your writing is lower quality but actually helps the
      reader understand your context better.
