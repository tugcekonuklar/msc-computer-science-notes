# Research terminology and definitions

* Methods
    * Research methods include all the techniques or methods that you adopt for conducting the research. These may be
      thought of as the data collection methods - experiments, surveys, interviews, observation etc.
* Methodology
    * Research methodology is the way in which the problems are systematically solved. Methodology is the science which
      studies **how** research is conducted, the steps taken to study a research problem, and the logic behind those
      steps. It is important as a researcher to understand the methods but also the scientific approach called
      methodology.
* Research Approaches : qualitative and quantitative
    * Research approaches are plans and the procedures for research that span the steps from broad assumptions to
      detailed methods of data collection, analysis, and interpretation.
* Informing this decision should be the philosophical assumptions the researcher brings to the study; procedures of
  inquiry (called research designs); and specific research methods of data collection, analysis, and interpretation.
* Research design considers issues such as "what", "when", "how much" and so forth.
    * It is the conceptual structure in which the research is constructed and includes the blueprint for the collection,
      measurement and analysis of the data
    * 3 types research design :
        * Exploratory research design
        * Descriptive and diagnostic research design
        * Hypothesis testing research design
* Research Philosophy
    * This refers to a system of beliefs and assumptions about the development of knowledge.
    * Assumptions you make throughout your research process which will include the realities you encounter in your
      research (ontological assumptions), about human knowledge (epistemological assumptions) and about the way your own
      values influence your research process (axiological assumptions).

* Research Paradigm
    * The research paradigm can be considered as the beliefs of the world that the researcher chooses to live in
    * 2 types : positivism and interpretivism
    * These shape and inform the views held on the research and in turn impact on the ontological, epistemological and
      methodological choices made by the researcher.

      </br><img src="./img/2/1.png" alt="alt text" width="500" height="300">
* Assumptions
    * Ontology assumptions refer to the nature of reality. You will have your own assumptions about the world that your
      research sits in, your perceptions which shape the way that you see and study your research objects, thus your
      choice of what to research.
    * Epistemology refers to assumptions about knowledge and what is acceptable, valid and legitimate knowledge and how
      that can be communicated to others (Burrel and Morgan, 2016).
    * Methodology relates to how we are to discover and validate what we think exists, what methods we will use to
      collect the data.
    * Axiology refers to the role of values and ethics. As a researcher, you need to reflect on the impact of your own
      values and beliefs and you must recognise these beliefs in the research. This may be as simple as choosing one
      topic over another as you think one is more important.

# Methodology & methods

* **Methodology**
* Explains the method you use to solve the problem, address the issue or answer the question.
* Study of the steps taken and the logic behind them.
* Examples
    * Qualitative Research
        * Content Analysis: derived from interviews, focus groups, open ended surveys, videos and documents.
        * History:  historical research involves understanding, studying, and explaining past events.
            * Its purpose is to arrive at some conclusions concerning past occurrences that may help to anticipate or
              explain present or future events.
        * Ethnographic :  can include virtually any group or organisation.
    * Quantitative Research
        * Experimental : Experimental research is any research conducted with a scientific approach, where a set of
          variables are kept constant while the other set of variables are being measured as the subject of experiment.
        * Quasi-experimental: Quasi-experiments manipulate presumed causes to discover their effects, but the researcher
          does not assign units to conditions randomly.
            * Quasi-experiments are necessary because it is not always possible to randomise.
        * Causal-comparative: Causal-comparative research attempts to identify a cause-effect relationship between two
          or more groups.
            * Causal-comparative studies involve comparison in contrast to correlation research which looks at
              relationships.
            * This degree of relation is expressed as a correlation coefficient.
        * Single subject: refers unique type of research methodologies that facilities into vension evaluation for the
          individual case.
        * Meta Analysis:  which is a statistical technique for amalgamating, summarising and reviewing previous
          quantitative research.
        * Survey: which involves the collection of information from a sample of individuals through their responses to
          questions.
    * Research by practitioner
        * Action: is a process where participants examine their own practice to improve it. It can be an immediate
          problem or reflective process of problem solving.

      </br><img src="./img/2/3.png" alt="alt text" width="500" height="300">

* **Method**
* The spesific techniques, producedures and or instruments you can use in order to answer the question or hypotesis.
* There is, process, tools and methods used to collect and analyse data.
* Examples:
    * Statistics, they analyse the data rather than just describing it - use it to tell a story that focuses on
      answering the research question.
    * Literature reviews, building and collecting your research on and relating it to existing knowledge.
    * Interviews which can be defined as a qualitative research technique which involves conducting intensive individual
      interviews with a small number of respondents to explore their perspectives on a particular idea, program or
      situationâ€™. regarding specific issues closely related to the research question or hypothesis.
    * Focus group
    * Dissertations, which is a method by which you are going to deliver the results of your research,what you deliver
      might take different shapes, depending on the context.
    * Research design. this might require the adoption of existing tools or the development of novel ones, to answer the
      question of the research. So it is not just the answer to the question, but one needs to figure out the needs to
      answer the question.
    * Surveys: which are about questioning individuals on a topic or topics and then describing their responses.
    * Case studies which aim to analyse specific issues within the boundaries of a specific environment, situation or
      organisation.
    * Experiments, which are used in order to analyse cause and effect relationships.
    * Observations and as the name implies, is a way of collecting data through observing.

## Model for Research

* There is a natural order which connects key elements of the research process.
* Understanding how elements research are connected is essential to designing quality research
* Research is not always a linear process, even though it may be depicted this way in models for research.

# Research methodology & strategy

* Research methodology is the element of the research process that describes and justifies the choice of strategy and
  data collection methods within a research project.
* quantitative, qualitative and mixed method research, based upon how theory is used

## Research Strategy

* a research strategy is a plan of how to conduct the research, connecting the theoretical aspects of the research
  design to the more practical elements of how to collect and analyse research data.
* **Quantitative strategies**
    * Experiment : A means of carrying out research (to test a hypothesis) in which a controlled change is made to a
      variable for an experimental group with all other potential variables kept constant, and the effect observed. The
      effect is then assumed to be the result of the change.

# Research approaches

* Once you have determined your research question and defined your variables, you can establish your research setting.
  For some, this will be a laboratory setting using a controlled environment.
* Applied research takes place in a neutral environment where people are acting normally, whereas basic theoretical
  research is more likely to take place in a lab.
    * Applied research attempts to address practical questions rather than theoretical questions, whereas theoretical
      research tests or expands on theory, with no direct application intended.
* You may next choose your methodology. When we make changes in a situation to see how these changes affect behaviour,
  this is known as a 'quasi-experimental' approach.
* Sometimes you may be interested in obtaining an extensive amount of information from the research participants. A case
  study is appropriate for one or more (few) individuals so that you can gather a rich body of data.
* If you are interested in a more holistic approach when studying people, qualitative research is the approach required.

# The purpose of research

* Understanding the purpose of research brings clarity to the research design process as it aligns what you want to know
  with how to find this out.
* Purpose of research. Bullet list and graphic of 3 question marks:
    * What sort of â€˜finding outâ€™ are you doing?
    * What sort of â€˜dataâ€™ you need
    * Broadly, research can be:
        * exploratory
            * Here the purpose is to find out what is going on and gain new insights into a particular phenomena or
              computing technology issue in order to generate ideas about further research that might be needed.
        * descriptive
            * Here the purpose of the research would be to provide a neutral and accurate account of the people, events
              and/or situations, drawing from extensive prior knowledge
            * This sort of research confirms existing understanding of social and organisational phenomena, what is
              happening, but is not concerned with explaining why things happen.
        * explanatory
            * This is where you seek to understand a particular phenomenon by identifying and explaining causal
              relationships between aspects of the phenomena under study. It seeks to increase depth of understanding of
              the subject or topic and assess the impact of change to norms and processes within the causal
              relationships identified.
            * One drawback could be that causality may be confirmed but not proven.
        * scientific
            * his is where the research paradigm is usually typed by the making of formal hypothesis and with the use of
              quantitative methods to assess their validity. Conclusions are drawn to imply that the hypothesis is true
              or false.

* The purpose of statement. Bullet point list with:
    * Intent
    * what
    * who
    * where
    * why
    * Example
        * an interpretivist research project might read as an
            * This research is an **ethnographic** study to **explore** the **cultural meaning** attributed by **office
              workers** to the building layouts of **call centres in India**
        * a purpose statement for positivist research project
            * This research is an **experiment** to **test** the hypothesis that regular use by **compliance officers**
              of hotline reporting **correlates** positively with better performance in **commercial UK firms**

* The research purpose is stated after the research problem has been identified and in support of it, clarifying what
  needs to be found out.
    * It lays the foundation for the logic behind the research and can affirm personal reason[s] for doing it.

* The purpose of research offers clarity and direction on what and how to address an identified research problem
* The purpose statement establishes the intent of the research (who, what, where, why).
* Language used is indicative of the research philosophy underpinning the research purpose.

## Stakeholder perspective in research design

* Having established the purpose of the research, the purpose statement communicates the intentions of the research to
  interested parties. When designing a research project, it is essential to understand who the key stakeholders are.
